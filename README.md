## Project Overview

Jammming was developed as a capstone project for Codecademy's React skill path. The goal of the project was to utilize React components, state management, and API integration to create a functional and user-friendly web application.

The main features of Jammming include:

    Search: Users can search for songs in the Spotify library by song title, artist name, genre, and more.
    Song Information: Jammming displays detailed information about each song, including title, artist, and album.
    Custom Playlists: Users can create their own custom playlists by adding songs from the search results.
    Spotify Integration: The application integrates with the Spotify API to authenticate users and save their custom playlists to their personal Spotify accounts.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used in the development of Jammming:

    HTML
    CSS
    JavaScript
    React
    Spotify API (for data retrieval and authentication)

## Features

    Search for Songs: Users can search for songs by entering song titles, artist names, genres, or any other relevant criteria.
    Song Information: The application displays detailed information about each song, including title, artist, and album.
    Custom Playlists: Users can add songs to their custom playlists by selecting them from the search results.
    Export to Spotify: Once users have created their custom playlist, they can export it directly to their personal Spotify account.
    Responsive Design: Jammming is designed to be fully responsive, providing an optimal user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## Future Work

Here are some potential areas for future enhancement and development of Jammming:

	Song Previews: Include preview samples for each track
    Search Results: Only display songs not currently present in the playlist in the search results
    Loading Screen: Add a loading screen while playlist is saving
    Access Token Expiration: Update the access token logic to expire at exactly the right time, instead of setting expiration from when the user initiates their next search
    Restore Search Term: After user redirect on login, restoring the search term from before the redirect
    Retain Playlist: Ensure playlist information doesn’t get cleared if a user has to refresh their access token
    Existing Playlists: Provide a way to fetch and see all your existing playlists
    User Authentication: Implement user authentication functionality to allow users to create and manage their own accounts within the application.
    Playlist Sharing: Enable users to share their custom playlists with others through social media platforms or direct links.
    Additional Music Sources: Expand the application's capabilities by integrating with other music streaming services, allowing users to search and add songs from multiple sources.
